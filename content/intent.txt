Dear Admissions Committee,I hope this message finds you well. My name is Akanksha, hailing from India, and I am writing to express my strong interest in pursuing the Master's in Computer Science program at Rutgers University for the Spring 2025 semester. I am also writing to formally request a waiver for the GRE/GMAT exam requirement for my application.Since childhood, I have been educated entirely in English-medium institutions, where English was the primary language of instruction throughout my academic career. From school to my university education at Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women (IGDTUW),I have always studied in an English-speaking environment, laying a strong foundation for my communication skills. Moreover, in my role as a Senior Software Engineer, the primary mode of communication, both written and verbal, has been English which has helped me to swiftly and clearly resolve client issues. My skill in understanding client requirements and building strong rapport through effective dialogue has been essential in delivering timely, tailored solutions. My command of English has played a pivotal role in leading diverse projects and fostering trust with international clients, ensuring their concerns are addressed efficiently and accurately. This adaptability and client-focused approach have been key drivers of my success.My academic background is similarly robust. I graduated with a Bachelor of Technology degree from IGDTUW, one of India's leading engineering institutions, having secured admission through the highly competitive AIEEE (now JEE Mains),ranking in the top 4% out of 1.4 million candidates. This strong academic foundation, alongside four years of hands-on experience working on impactful software projects, has sharpened my technical, problem-solving, and leadership abilities. These achievements, along with my proven track record of success, reflect my readiness for the Masterâ€™s in computer science program at Rutgers University and should be considered in lieu of standardized test scores.The curriculum at Rutgers aligns perfectly with my interests in areas such as data structures, algorithms, and system design, and I am confident that my background has provided me with the skills necessary to excel in the program.I kindly request that my extensive professional experience, along with my academic achievements and English language proficiency, be considered in lieu of the GRE/GMAT requirement. I am attaching my resume for your reference and would be happy to provide any additional materials or clarification if needed.Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your positive response.Thanks and RegardsAkanksha Delhi, India+91 8505801545App ID - 2204897
