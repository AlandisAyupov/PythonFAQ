Rutgers Connect is based on Microsoft's Office 365 suite and is part of the President’s Strategic Plan for Rutgers University. All university email systems are consolidated into this single solution, which is the official university email and calendaring system for all Faculty and Staff. If you are a current Faculty or Staff member within the university, or a Student with an RBHS role, you are most likely auto-provisioned for a Connect (Office 365) account. Connect accounts are mostly administered within a department: 1. Open up a web browser and go to the Rutgers Connect page. 2. Enter your Rutgers Connect email formatted as netid@yourdomain.rutgers.edu. Select Next then enter your Rutgers NetID password and click Sign In. Note: If you do not know your Connect sign-in email, follow the steps below to retrieve it. Go to the email self service page. Scroll to the Rutgers Connect Account Information section and use the email listed next to Sign in to Rutgers Connect using: netid@yourdomain.rutgers.edu 3. Follow the prompts to sign in with your Duo Two-Step authentication. For more information on Duo Two-Step login please reference the What is two-step login with Duo? article. 4.

2,"Make sure you have already activated your ScarletMail account on the Services Activation page. To access ScarletMail via a web browser, go to Gmail and login with your netid@scarletmail.rutgers.edu address. It will then prompt you to login with your NetID and NetID password."
3,"We do not recommend doing this. Fall and Spring Session Students are required to have ScarletMail accounts so that they can receive official messages from Rutgers. We cannot guarantee delivery of official Rutgers email to non-Rutgers accounts. In addition per University Policy 70.1.6, all email and calendaring used to conduct University Business must be created, stored, processed, and transmitted using the official University Email and Calendaring systems; where University Business is defined as ""work performed as part of an employee’s job responsibilities, daily work, and duties performed on behalf of the University by faculty, staff, student workers, guests, and other persons."" Ensure that none of your ScarletMail emails fall within this definition if you set up forwarding. The recommended way of forwarding to an external account is using the auto forward feature built into Gmail. Follow Google's guide on how to automatically forward Gmail messages to another account. It is highly recommended that during the setup process you select to keep a copy of the email on ScarletMail. You may prefer to read the copies on the external account, but if a message fails to be delivered there, this will allow you to be able to find the copy on the ScarletMail account. Please make sure to log into your ScarletMail account every so often to delete any unneeded duplicate messages."
4,"ScarletMail accounts are required to use the NetID as the account name, so it is not possible. However, you can set up a personalized email address, or mail alias, in the form of “firstname.lastname@rutgers.edu”, and set ScarletMail (or most preferred mail programs) to send using that address in the From line, rather than the netid@scarletmail.rutgers.edu address. Visit the article on setting up ScarletMail to use your official Rutgers email address for more details. "
5,"Students can continue to use their personal Gmail account. A ScarletMail account is a separate account that does not affect existing Gmail accounts. The advantage of the Google Workspace for Education account is that each person has a Google account in an ad-free environment that maintains your Rutgers identity through your email address. The difference is mostly on the look and feel of the applications. Behind the scenes, Google also delegates control of Rutgers Google Apps and user accounts to Rutgers system administrators."
6,"For email options for Rutgers students, ScarletMail is the official email service for Rutgers Students. Students in schools that handle protected health information (PHI) will be granted Rutgers Connect accounts to be used as their primary email account. Departments may provide additional email accounts to students if needed. "
7,"Gmail is different from regular email services in that it does not use a folder system for organizing emails. Instead, it uses Filters and Labels. For more information, visit Google's support page on how to organize and find emails. There you will find information on Filters, Labels, Storage and Archiving."
8,"If you delete a message or document, it will be placed in your Trash folder for 30 days. After 30 days, it will be deleted permanently. However, once you click Empty Trash now or Delete Forever the deleted message can no longer be retrieved. OIT does not have access to restore deleted data. Visit Google's site for more information on deleting messages."
9,Your ScarletMail email address is in the format of netid@scarletmail.rutgers.edu. It is recommended that you create and use an email alias (e.g. first.last@rutgers.edu). You can manage your delivery email addresses (where you want your email delivered) and your aliases (the address that you give people to use to contact you) by going to the NetID Management page and click on Manage Email Addresses. 
10,If you are an affiliate of the Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences department your default email account will be Connect (Office 365). This is because those with an active RBHS role are typically flagged in our systems as having access to Protected Health Information (PHI). Connect is not open to third-party applications and is designed by Rutgers to keep protected health information secure. RBHS affiliates can obtain a ScarletMail but are only allowed to set a delivery address that is an RBHS email account (Connect). They are only allowed to use their alias or RBHS email account as an official Rutgers email address and are not permitted to forward their RBHS email to another account (such as ScarletMail). Both your Connect and ScarletMail can be setup during your NetID activation process or through Service Activation.
11,"Reminder: This service uses your ScarletApps Mobile/POP/IMAP Password. If you do not know or remember this password, review the instructions on how to create or change your ScarletApps password.

12,"You can send up to 25 MB in attachments. If you have more than one attachment, they cannot add up to more than 25 MB. If your file is greater than 25 MB, Gmail automatically adds a Google Drive link in the email instead of including it as an attachment. For more detailed instructions, visit the Google Help article on how to send attachments with your Gmail message.

If they don't, you'll be prompted to change the sharing settings of the file before you send your message.

15,"Only Alumni, Retirees and Professor Emeritus are eligible to keep their ScarletMail/ScarletApps account after leaving the University. People who leave Rutgers without formally graduating, even if only for one semester, are subject to losing their account. These accounts are subject to regular audits to check if it is still actively being used. If you are in one of these groups and your account is deemed inactive, you will be contacted to confirm that you are still using the account. It will remain active so long as you respond to these inquiries in a timely fashion. If there is no response, the account will be closed and all data will be permanently deleted. Alumni who no longer want their ScarletMail accounts should write to help@oit.rutgers.edu from their ScarletMail account, as proof they are the account owner, to request its closure.

You may also wish to add a distinguishing title such as Dr. to your name, change your First name to a nickname, or your Last name if you are married.
